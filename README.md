# netvisor

netVisor is an app developed during the SmartHack Hackathon(18 teams were selected out of 104). The app won the second place from Microsoft, with the mention that it was really hard to decide which app to place first.

The app basically bring the vision of Jira and Azure Devopes into daily life. 

The problem we identified is that in a building with a lot of people, minnor defects may occur. For example the water dispenser can run out of water and before someone could refill it, it may take some time.

Our solution is to print QR codes and stick them to the devices that use consumables (for example). When they run out of the consumable, the emplyees who use it can report the issue fast by using the Android App. The process doesn't take more than 5 seconds. 
After that, there will be opened an issue inside the application and a Janitor (for example) can take the task to solve the issue. It will be marked as "assinged to X", and when he finishes he can mark it as solved.
